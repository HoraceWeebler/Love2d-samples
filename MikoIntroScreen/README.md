LOVEJam Intro Screen
===========

This sample is inspired by the [LOVEJam] site.

This is a splash screen intro, and also an engine, where you can easily make similar intros for yourself.

The intro consists of some linef of texts and some images and audio files. The texts will be split by letters, and the images and letters will be put randomly, then will find their way home. Also, the letters get some random colors at the beginning.
