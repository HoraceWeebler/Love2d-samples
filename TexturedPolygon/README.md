Textured Polygon
===========

This sample is inspired by the [TexturedPolygon] thread.

Given the texture image, it places it (multiple times) on your framebuffer (only on non-black pixels). So create your image (e.g. filled polygon) first, and then call texturize(framebuffer, texture) to get your image.
